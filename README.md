# Image-Classification

Developed a deep learning model which predicts the animal whether it is a cat or a dog using CNN and Keras
Convert the sizes of the image into one for the model to understand clearly and visualize it using Matplotlib
Implemented convolutional, MaxPooling, and flattening layers in the model so that it learns directly from the data
Utilized loss functions and optimizers which helps in reducing total loss and improve accuracy
